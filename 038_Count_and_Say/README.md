 Count and Say (C – Line by Line Explanation)

 Problem Statement
The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined as:

- countAndSay(1) = "1"
- countAndSay(n) is the run-length encoding (RLE) of countAndSay(n - 1)

Given a positive integer `n`, return the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

---

 Core Idea
Each term is generated by **describing the previous term**.

We read the previous string and:
- Count consecutive identical digits
- Say the count followed by the digit

This is exactly **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**.

 C Solution with Explanation

```c
char* countAndSay(int n) {
```
This is the function signature provided by LeetCode.
It returns the nth sequence as a string.

    char* result = (char*)malloc(2 * sizeof(char));
    result[0] = '1';
    result[1] = '\0';


We start with the base case n = 1, which is "1".
Memory is allocated dynamically as required by LeetCode.

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {


We build the sequence step by step from 2 to n.

        int len = strlen(result);


We find the length of the current sequence
so we know how many characters to process.

        char* temp = (char*)malloc(2 * len + 1);
        int idx = 0;


A temporary string is created to store the next sequence.
2 * len + 1 is enough space for count and digit pairs.

        for (int j = 0; j < len; j++) {
            int count = 1;


We start reading the current sequence character by character
and initialize a counter for repeated digits.

            while (j + 1 < len && result[j] == result[j + 1]) {
                count++;
                j++;
            }


This loop counts how many times the same digit
appears consecutively.

            temp[idx++] = count + '0';


The count is converted to a character and added to temp.

            temp[idx++] = result[j];


The digit being counted is added after the count.

        }


End of reading the current sequence.

        temp[idx] = '\0';


We terminate the new string properly.

        free(result);
        result = temp;


We free the old string and update result
to point to the newly generated sequence.

    }


The loop ends after generating the nth sequence.

    return result;
}


We return the final count-and-say string.
