This repository contains my LeetCode problem solutions written in C.
I created this repository to practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), improve my problem-solving skills, and track my learning journey.

Each solution includes clean code, efficient logic, and a clear explanation of my approach.

For a better understanding of DSA, I studied DSA with C (Third Edition) by Reema Thareja.
I also watched tutorials from Apna College and used various tools for deeper understanding, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other AI tools.
